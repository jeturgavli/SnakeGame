# SnakeGame
This is an HTML and JavaScript code for a simple game called "SnakeMania". The game consists of a board where a snake moves around and eats food. The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible without the snake colliding with the walls or itself.

The HTML code defines the layout of the game board, including the score, high score, and board. The JavaScript code defines the game constants, variables, and functions required to play the game.

The code first defines the game constants and variables, including the snake's initial position, the food position, and the game sounds. The game functions are then defined, including the main function, which is called repeatedly using window.requestAnimationFrame.

The game engine function is responsible for updating the snake's position and checking for collisions with the wall or food. If a collision occurs, the game is over, and the score is reset. If the snake eats food, the score is incremented, and the food is regenerated. The snake is then displayed on the board using HTML elements.

The main logic for the game is then defined, which plays the music and retrieves the high score from local storage, if available. Finally, the user input is captured using the arrow keys, which controls the direction of the snake's movement.

Overall, this is a simple but well-structured JavaScript code for a basic game that is easy to understand and modify.
